Each time the decision maker observes an item in the list, she recalls previous alternatives with some probability, conditional on those alternatives being recalled until this point. We provide conditions on observable choice probabilities that characterize the model. We show that the preference ordering, the list ordering the decision maker follows and the memory parameters are uniquely identified up to the ranking of the two least preferred alternatives. We apply our model to study the pricing problem of a monopolist who faces consumers with limited memory. We show that when forgetting is severe, the monopolist is better off charging a lower price than the optimal price in the perfect memory case.","tags":null,"title":"Stochastic Choice with Limited Memory","type":"publication"}]
